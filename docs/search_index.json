Generators allow you to return only one value of a loop at a time. So in the code below, the training step will call the generator at each step, but when it hits ‘yield’, it will return the data the training code. Once the training code calls the generator again, it will pick up at the same place it left off and continue with the for loop, returning the next batch of data. This way, we only ever load one batch data into memory at a time. def get_train(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Training data generator &quot;&quot;&quot; for file in train_files: img = ( np.array(nc.Dataset(file, &quot;r&quot;)[&quot;ims&quot;][0:1])[0], np.array(nc.Dataset(file, &quot;r&quot;)[&quot;migrants&quot;][0:1]) ) yield img def get_val(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Validation data generator &quot;&quot;&quot; for file in val_files: img = ( np.array(nc.Dataset(file, &quot;r&quot;)[&quot;ims&quot;][0:1])[0], np.array(nc.Dataset(file, &quot;r&quot;)[&quot;migrants&quot;][0:1]) ) yield img Loading generators as TF Datasets To be compatible with TF’s model.fit() method, we need to convert our generators into tf.data.Dataset() objects. We do this by calling the constructing on our generator function name and specifying the output types of our batch data. IMAGERY_DIR = &quot;/sciclone/scr-mlt/hmbaier/cropped/&quot; files = os.listdir(IMAGERY_DIR) files = [IMAGERY_DIR + i for i in files if &quot;484&quot; in i] print(&quot;Number of nCDF files: &quot;, len(files)) train_files, val_files = train_test_split(files, .75) train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(generator = get_train, output_types=(tf.float32, tf.float32)).batch(int(args.world_size)) val_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(generator = get_val, output_types=(tf.float32, tf.float32)).batch(int(args.world_size)) print(&quot;Number of training files: &quot;, len(train_files)) print(&quot;Number of validation files: &quot;, len(val_files)) &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of nCDF files: &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of training files: &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of validation files: Initializing the MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy() strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy() with strategy.scope(): train_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(train_dataset) val_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(val_dataset) multi_worker_model = resnet.resnet56(img_input = tf.keras.layers.Input((None, None, 3)), classes = 1) multi_worker_model.compile( optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate = 0.001), loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanAbsoluteError(), metrics=[tf.keras.losses.MeanAbsoluteError()] ) Train the MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy() model multi_worker_model.fit(train_dataset, steps_per_epoch = int(len(files) // int(args.world_size)), validation_data = val_dataset) 4.2.2.1 Launching a Tensorflow MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy() script Launching a multi-worker training job is a little more intricate than simply calling python train.py. In order to set up our cluster, we need to know the IP addresses of each node in our job, then we need to launch the training scipt on each node individually. We’ll use a set of bash scripts to do this. run.sh The rm commands inthis script delete files from any previous runs. The purpose of this script is to qsub the tflow_job.sh job on the number of nodes that you want to include in training. This is the only scipt you’ll run to launch your training. You can use it by running: ./run.sh &lt;NUM_NODES&gt; rm -R /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/ mkdir /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/ rm -R /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/logs/ mkdir /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/logs/ for ((i = 1; i &lt;= $1; i++)) do qsub /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/tflow_job.sh -l nodes=1:vortex:ppn=1 -v NODE_NUM=$i,WORLD_SIZE=$1 done #!/bin/tcsh #PBS -N head_node #PBS -l walltime=10:00:00 #PBS -j oe hostname -i &gt; /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/$NODE_NUM.txt set size=`ls /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/ | wc -l` while ( $size != $WORLD_SIZE ) set size=`ls /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/ | wc -l` sleep 1 end echo &quot;$size&quot; # init conda within new shell for job source &quot;/usr/local/anaconda3-2021.05/etc/profile.d/conda.csh&quot; module load anaconda3/2021.05 unsetenv PYTHONPATH conda activate tflow python3 /sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/worker_v5.py $NODE_NUM $WORLD_SIZE &gt; &quot;/sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/logs/log${NODE_NUM}.txt&quot; Connecting to the Python script: Setting up the training cluster using TF_CONFIG The tflow_job you submitted through run.sh will call a file called ips.sh that will save a text file with thte IP address of each node that will participate in training. At the beginning of our python training script, we will use this make_config function to format those IP address into the environment variable Tensorflow needs to set up it’s training cluster. ips_direc = &quot;/sciclone/home20/hmbaier/tflow/ips/&quot; os.environ[&quot;TF_CONFIG&quot;] = make_config(int(args.rank) - 1, ips_direc, 45962) def make_config(rank, direc, port): ips = [] for file in os.listdir(direc): with open(direc + file, &quot;r&quot;) as f: ips.append(f&quot;{f.read().splitlines()[0]}:{port}&quot;) config = {&quot;cluster&quot;: {&quot;worker&quot;: ips}, &quot;task&quot;: {&quot;index&quot;: int(rank), &quot;type&quot;: &quot;worker&quot;}} return json.dumps(config) Replication Code Replication code is in the folder: https://github.com/heatherbaier/distributed-wm.github.io/tree/gh-pages/examples/tf_mwms To launch the training script, open up a terminal and ssh into Vortex. If you’ve never done the tutorial before, copy the below into your terminal and hit enter. mkdir tf_mwms cd tf_mwms git init . git remote add -f origin https://github.com/heatherbaier/distributed-wm.github.io.git git config core.sparseCheckout true echo &quot;examples/tf_mwms/&quot; &gt;&gt; .git/info/sparse-checkout git pull origin master git checkout gh-pages cd examples/tf_mwms chmod +x run.sh ./run.sh &lt;NUM_NODES&gt; If you’ve done the tutorial before, simply cd into examples/tf_mwms and run: ./run.sh &lt;NUM_NODES&gt; 4.2.3 References &amp; Helpful Sites 4.3 Other Distributed Training Frameworks 4.3.1 Microsoft’s DeepSpeed "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
